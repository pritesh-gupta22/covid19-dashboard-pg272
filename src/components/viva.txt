**🚀 GFO Tech Lunch & Learn – Showcasing Our Strength, Shaping Our Future! 🍽️**

The **GFO Technology India** team recently hosted an exciting **Tech Lunch & Learn** session, bringing together all our domain teams under one roof to share, connect, and inspire.

Each team took the stage to talk about **who we are, what we do, and where we’re headed** – covering our role in Wealth Passport across key domains:

🔹 **Data & Reporting**
🔹 **Experience**
🔹 **Transactions**
🔹 **Self-service Enrollments & Entitlements**
🔹 **Financial Management**
🔹 **Utilities & Documents**
🔹 **HUB Team** (managing horizontal initiatives)
🔹 **Service Delivery & SRE Practices**
🔹 **Public Cloud Journey & Updates**

We were privileged to have **Pune leadership from Wealth Management, NTAM, and the entire GFO Technology India team** in attendance, making this event even more impactful.

The day was not all tech – after the knowledge sessions, we turned up the fun with **interactive games**, followed by a delicious lunch that brought everyone together.

A big **thank you** to all presenters, coordinators, and leaders who made this event a success – and to everyone who participated and engaged so energetically. The positive energy and collaboration we experienced here truly reflect the spirit of GFO Technology India.

📸 Here’s a glimpse of the moments we captured together!

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, punchier version** for maximum engagement with more catchy lines and less text so it pops in Viva Engage’s feed. That will help your post stand out visually.
